Time Series Analysis:

step 1:Analysing a data
step 2:use of date column as an index
step 3 :setting the desired frequencey
          
          use asfreq() method
step 4: Handling missing data
        fillna have 3 methods
           * forward filling - uses last known value
           * backward filling - uses next known value
           * same filling
           * mean
           * median ,etc
           
           
           
step 5:
module 1:
whitenoise time series - no pattern between past and the future (time periods)
       in other words we can also say constant mean, constant variance,no correlation between any periods
       
       market efficiency: measures the level of fifficulty in forecasting correct future values
       
module 2:Random walk

          characteristics: * the difference between the periods are white noise
                           * the best estimator of todays value is yesterdays value
                           * the best estimator of tommorows value is today value
module 3: stationarity

         covarince stationarity:
         
                              * constant mean
                              * constant variance
                              *cov(xn,xn+1)=cov(xm,xm+1)`   
                              
                              test static< critical value = stationary

module 4: Seasonality
          
          3 types of decompostion:
                    *trend        - pattern
                    *seasonality  - cyclical effects
                    *residual     - Error of Prediction
          
          Naive decompostion-  The simplest type of decomposition is called naive with naive decomposition.
                               We expect a linear relationship between the three parts and the observed time series.
                               Now let's pay attention to the two main approaches to naive decomposition additive or multiplicative
          
          
          additive -           for any time period the observed value is the sum of the trend seasonal and residual for that period.
                                trend+season+residual
          multiplicative -     the original series is a product of the trend seasonal and residual values to make things more convenient.
                                 trend*season*residual
