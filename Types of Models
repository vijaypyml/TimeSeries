AR model(Auto Regressive model):
           
            a linear model where a current period values are a sum of past outcomes multiplied by a numeric factor.
            
            For instance if we take X as a time series variable then an example of an A.R. model would look something like this.
            X in period t equals sum constant C plus a numeric coefficient fi times X in period T minus one plus
            epsilon T.
