AR model(Auto Regressive model):
           
            a linear model where a current period values are a sum of past outcomes multiplied by a numeric factor.
            
            For instance if we take X as a time series variable then an example of an A.R. model would look something like this.
            X in period t equals sum constant C plus a numeric coefficient fi times X in period T minus one plus
            epsilon T.
              
          
steps:

*check for stationarity
*use adfuller test and plots to see the trends in data 
*if descriptive statistics like mean and variance is consistent for all time periods then the data is stationary.
*time series model will perform more efiiciently with stationary data.
* Normalizing soes not Affect Stationarity


MA Model:(Moving Average model)


1 MA model = AR Model(infinity)

*In MA model the independent variable is residual but in the AR model it is the value of the variable.

* MA model will perform good at Random walk data.


ARMA model:

conditions need to check:

* all coefficients need to be significant
* High log likelihood
* Low information criteria
